# Roles and permissions

**Status: CURRENT**

FloCafe currently has five fixed staff roles: owner, manager, cashier, server, and chef. This document describes the default role boundaries in the application. It is a read-only reference - it does not configure access.

The same read-only matrix is available in the Staff page for owners and managers. The runtime source of truth is [`shared/role-permissions.ts`](../shared/role-permissions.ts): backend route gates use its `ROLE_ACCESS` groups, and the in-app table is generated from its `PERMISSION_CAPABILITIES` list. This means the displayed matrix stays accurate when a route changes **if the route and capability are updated to use the shared constants**; it is not a separate database or IAM policy.

## Permission matrix

A check means the role is allowed to use the capability. A dash means it is not allowed. The table groups capabilities by area and uses the same capabilities shown in Staff > Role permissions.

## Important scope notes

- **Read-only display:** The in-app table does not offer role editing, permission toggles, or IAM configuration. These permissions are currently fixed by role. Role configuration/IAM is not available yet.
- **Owner and manager visibility:** The matrix is rendered only for an authenticated owner or manager on the Staff page. The API continues to enforce authorization independently; hiding a UI control is not a security boundary.
- **KDS scope:** Chef access is further narrowed by assigned `category_ids` and kitchen stations. Owner and manager KDS access is unrestricted by category, subject to the KDS being enabled.
- **Cashier POS (one PC):** Waiters, cashiers, managers, and owners sign in with PIN on the same KorgenKassa window. Switch user / Lock till returns to the PIN pad without signing out of Windows. Waiters can take and send orders (including kitchen tickets). Closing the check and taking payment stay with cashier, manager, or owner.
- **Server App:** The standalone Server App is intentionally restricted to `server`, `manager`, and `owner` roles. It is separate from the dashboard navigation. Waiters can use it on phones over HTTPS (VPS) or cafe Wi‑Fi; the hall till is optional and does not have to stay on.
- **Staff management:** Managers can manage operational staff, but cannot modify or deactivate owner/manager accounts. Only owners can change roles for an existing account, and the last active owner cannot be demoted.
- **Conditional surfaces:** Business type, feature settings (such as KDS or WhatsApp), and account state can hide or disable a surface without changing the fixed role boundary.

## Research-backed presentation choice

The in-app version uses roles as columns and capabilities as rows, with grouped areas, a semantic HTML table, explicit Allowed/Not allowed text paired with check/dash icons, and horizontal overflow with a sticky capability column. This keeps cross-role comparison fast while preserving table semantics and context at narrow desktop widths. The pattern follows [W3C table guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/), [GOV.UK table guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/), and [WCAG guidance on non-color state indicators](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html).
